# Image_Colorization using pix2pix

This project implements an image colorization technique using the Pix2Pix GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) framework. The model takes grayscale images as input and generates corresponding color images. It leverages the Pix2Pix architecture to learn the mapping from grayscale to color images effectively.

## Dataset 
The Dataset used in the pix2pix model is [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shravankumar9892/image-colorization)
